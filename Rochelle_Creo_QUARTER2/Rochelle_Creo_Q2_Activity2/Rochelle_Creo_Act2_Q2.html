                of carnivorous mammals belonging to the Canidae family</ins></b>. Foxes are small to
                medium-sized canids (slightly smaller than median-size domestic dog), 
                characterized by possessing a long narrow snout,
                and a bushy tail (or brush).

                <ins><b>Members of about 37 species are reffered
                    to as foxes, of which only 12 species actually 
                    belong to the Vulpes genus of "true foxes"</ins></b>.By far the most common and 
                    widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes),although various species
                    are found on Almost every continent.The presence of fox-like carnivores all over 
                    the globe has led to their appearance in both popular culture and folklore in many

                    canine species known to climb trees; the other is the raccoon dog.
